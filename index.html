    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <p>The projects I've worked on to-date have been part of my entry into the world of software development.
      I started with an interest in Data Analytics and Machine Learning, but felt as though I was missing the foundational
      knowledge. Therefore, my 12-weeks at <a href="https://www.lighthouselabs.ca/">Lighthouse Labs</a> provided me those foundations. The projects below are mostly 
      from my early exploration through Udacity courses, then what I worked up during the Lighthouse Labs bootcamp.

  <!-- BIOGRAPHY -->
  <div class="row biography">
    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p>Chris Mastel is a Calgary, Alberta based full-stack developer. After spending time as an engineer in the 
      oil and gas industry, it was time to learn some new skills. Taking courses in Data Analytics and Artificial
      Intelligence confirmed his interest in the programming world, but there seemed to be something missing. By
      taking the Web Development Bootcamp through Lighthouse Labs, he was able to lay the foundations of a new 
      career in software development.</p>
      <p>Whenever he isn't in front of a computer, you can generally find him on some
      sort of adventure in the Rocky Mountains. Backpacking, canoeing, and skiing are the perfect balance to the 
      world of software development!
